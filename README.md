## Recipe Aggregator

### Introduction
Finding reliable recipes on the internet can be a challenge. Despite the abundance of information and options available, there is rarely a consensus on what ingredients belong in any given dish, and multiple highly-rated recipes for the same dish will sometimes differ dramatically. Which recipe is _actually_ the best? The most authentic? In all likelihood, the best version of the recipe is likely somewhere in the middle ground between a number of 'nearby' options.

With this in mind, my goal is to create a tool that will simplify and improve the online recipe search by condensing the overwhelming range of choices into a small handful of reliable and authentic recipes, each representing a different variation of a given dish (e.g., 'chili' --> 'beef/tomato/bean chili', 'white chicken chili', 'vegetarian chili', etc.)


will simplify the online recipe search. By quantifying and comparing a wide variety of recipes, taking into account user reviews and the reliability of the author, this tool will then generate an optimal recipe for any given dish. Furthermore, by comparing the similarity of 'nearby' recipes and styles, it will be able to make recommendations for potential fusion dishes.
